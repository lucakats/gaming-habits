This repository contains my first R project, completed through postgraduate study as an individual task. We were instructed to:

1. Choose a topic that interested us
2. Find a set of data on the topic
3. Build questions that could be answered through analysis
4. Conduct the analysis

The analysis included data tidying and transforming, exploring and visualizing, and finally discussing findings and conclusions. R code was written in an .Rmd file (R Markdown), which, when rendered, allowed presenting code chunks, visualizations (graphs) and findings in a nicer, easier to read way.

Included in this repo is the rendered PDF version of the .Rmd project file (the .Rmd is also included), as well as the data set used in analysis. Please view both the PDF (for final report) and R Markdown (for R code).

Later on (for assignment 2) we were asked to convert our R Markdown to a Shiny web app using Shiny in R. The link for my Shiny app is https://lucakats.shinyapps.io/Assignment2/. Please also feel free to check this out.
